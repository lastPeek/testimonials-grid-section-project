                transition and have heard some people who had an amazing
                experience here. I signed up for <br />
                the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled
                shortly thereafter. The next 12 <br />
                weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since
                completing the course, I’ve <br />

                “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve <br />
                never written a line of code. I needed <br />
                some structure from professionals <br />
                who can help me learn programming <br />
                step by step. I was encouraged to <br />
                enroll by a former student of theirs <br />
                who can only say wonderful things <br />
                about the program. The entire <br />
                curriculum and staff did not <br />
                disappoint. They were very hands-on <br />
                and I never had to wait long for <br />
                assistance. The agile team project, in <br />
                particular, was outstanding. It took <br />
                my learning to the next level in a way <br />
                that no tutorial could ever have. In <br />
                fact, I’ve often referred to it during <br />
                interviews as an example of my <br />
                developent experience. It certainly <br />
                helped me land a job as a full-stack <br />
                developer after receiving multiple <br />
                offers. 100% recommend! ”
